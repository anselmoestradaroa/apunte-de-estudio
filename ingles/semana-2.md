## 🗒 Class Content

### 📘 Unit 1 – **Becoming Culturally Literate**

### 🤷‍♂️ May or Might

We use **may** or **might** to express uncertain possibility.  
> "May" is slightly more certain than "might".

> You **might** be able to attend the chat on Thursday.  
> (Podrías asistir al chat...)

### 🛑 Drawing Conclusions Without Contractions

To express logical conclusions using **must** or **must not**, do **not** use contractions.

> You **must not** smoke here.  
> (No deberías fumar aquí.)

> He **must not** know that the schedule changed.  
> (Debe no saber que el horario cambió.)

---

## 📚 GRAMMAR | Modals: must, may, and might

### ✅ Use **must** + base verb form:
To **draw a conclusion** or indicate something is probably true.

> A: I got home from the movie after midnight last night.  
> B: Wow. You **must be** really tired this morning!  

> A: Where’s Ed? He should be here by now.  
> B: He **must not know** that the schedule changed.

### 🤔 Use **may** or **might** + base verb:
To express **uncertain possibilities**.

> I **may** (or **might**) be a little late tomorrow.  
> I **may not** (or **might not**) recognize Kate. I haven’t seen her in years.

### 🧠 Combine with **be able to** for possibility or conclusion:

> You **might be able** to get an appointment today.  
> We **must be able** to park here. I don’t see a no-parking sign.

#### ⚠️ Don’t say:
- I **might can** get an appointment today. ❌  
- We **must not can** park here. ❌
